# Django REST API Learnings  
**Advanced Concepts & Practical Implementations**  
*A learning path guided by [Coding for Entrepreneurs (CFE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c708Nf0cHrs)*  

---

## üöÄ Overview  
This repository showcases my progression from Django fundamentals to advanced REST API development using Django REST Framework (DRF). Through CFE's course, I focused on building scalable, secure, and efficient APIs while documenting my journey on LinkedIn.

## ÔøΩ Key Skills & Concepts  
### **Core Topics Explored**  
1. **CRUD Operations**  
   - Built RESTful APIs with full Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete functionality.  
   - Mastered serializers, model relationships, and DRF‚Äôs request-response flow.  

2. **Generic Views & Mixins**  
   - Implemented `GenericAPIView`, `ListCreateAPIView`, and `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView` to reduce redundancy.  
   - Combined `mixins.CreateModelMixin` and `mixins.ListModelMixin` for flexible logic reuse.  

3. **Authentication & Permissions**  
   - Integrated **Token Authentication** and **JWT** for secure user access.  
   - Customized permissions using `@permission_classes` decorators and Django‚Äôs built-in permission classes.  

4. **Search Optimization**  
   - Utilized Django‚Äôs native search filters for basic queries.  
   - Enhanced performance with **Algolia Search API** for real-time, scalable search results.  

5. **Viewsets & Routers**  
   - Simplified URL routing with `ModelViewSet` and `DefaultRouter`.  
   - Reduced boilerplate code while maintaining endpoint clarity.
